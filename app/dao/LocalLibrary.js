        description: `Why have people from different cultures and eras formulated myths and stories 
        with similar structures? What does this similarity tell us about the mind, morality, and 
        structure of the world itself? Jordan Peterson offers a provocative new hypothesis that 
        explores the connection between what modern neuropsychology tells us about the brain and what 
        rituals, myths, and religious stories have long narrated. A cutting-edge work that brings together 
        neuropsychology, cognitive science, and Freudian and Jungian approaches to mythology and narrative, 
        Maps of Meaning presents a rich theory that makes the wisdom and meaning of myth accessible to the critical modern mind.`

        title: "Crime and Punishment", 
        author: "Fjodor Dostojevskij", 
        genre: "Philosophic fiction", 
        published: "1866", 
        price: "199 SEK",
        description: `Raskolnikov, a destitute and desperate former student, wanders through the slums of St Petersburg 
        and commits a random murder without remorse or regret. He imagines himself to be a great man, a Napoleon: acting
        for a higher purpose beyond conventional moral law. But as he embarks on a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a 
        suspicious police investigator, Raskolnikov is pursued by the growing voice of his conscience and finds the noose of
        his own guilt tightening around his neck. Only Sonya, a downtrodden prostitute, can offer the chance of redemption.
        This vivid translation by David McDuff has been acclaimed as the most accessible version of Dostoyevskyâ€™s great novel, 
        rendering its dialogue with a unique force and naturalism.`
